"The true challenge to artificial intelligence proved to be solving the tasks that are easy for people to perform but are hard for people to describe formally - problems that we solve intuitively, that feel automatic, like recognizing spoken words or faces in images."

This book describes solutions to these intuitive problems. These solutions teach computers about hierarchies of concepts through experience or example.  More complex concepts are described in terms of simpler concepts in layers.  The multitude layers gives rise to the name deep learning.

"One of the key challenges in AI is how to get this informal knowledge [about the world] into a computer."
